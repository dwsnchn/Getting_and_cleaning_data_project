This is the project for Coursera Getting and Cleaning data. It includes run_analysis.R and Readme.md files.

1. Download and unzip files from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

 to working directory. Place run_analysis.R in the working directory. Run it and it would create a file called second_dt.txt, which includes the mean of original data by activity types.
